# LockOut
AutoHotkey program designed to use custom sounds, splash text, notices, and even command prompt commands at user-defined times.

1. It puts an audible notice when it's almost bedtime, and
2. It shuts down the computer when it hits that bedtime (with enough warning and delay so one can save their work

Yes, this shutdown can be cancelled
No, this program isn't hidden

The intention was never to make a program that takes complete control. I just needed something wtrong enough that stopping this shutdown requires a conscous decision and some effort. 

# Okay, but why Autohotkey?

Simply enough, it's simple enough. Very few languages and tools allow for immediate code execution. Most languages also require a lot of, for lack of a better term, "framework code" in order to do what AutoHotkey can already do. I would have to create objects and declare functions for playing sounds and running windows commands.

# Why a GitHub?

My plan is to rewrite this program for
